    <h3>Bagels</h3>
    <p>The famous New York bagel appears to have gotten its start in Poland
      sometime in the 1400s, and possibly earlier. Eastern European Jews likely
      became associated with the bagel because it was one of the first breads
      they were allowed to bake and, eventually  to sell commercially. As Jews
      emigrated from from the Old Country and landed in America, they bought
      along the bagel. By 1900, food writer Joan Nathan points out, there were
      at least 70 bagel bakeries on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
    <p>Despite their strong "Jewish food" association, bagels don't have religious
       significance. But thanks to their circular shape, they are often served at
       lifecycle events, ranging from as bris and baby naming parties to shiva
       houses. Interestingly, in 17th century Krakow, community records show they
       were even given as gifts to women who had just given birth. </p>
